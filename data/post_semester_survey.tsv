Machine learning would be interesting to go more into depth	If we are not retaking the group again but would be interesting in revisiting some of the meetings/concepts could we do something like that (drop in to some of the meetings)? Olivia and I asked about this at our last meeting but I wanted to double check.

I learn best through hands on work, especially when that work is something I am interested in, so getting to learn the languages just by doing them was incredibly helpful. With that, getting skeleton code (for DESeq2 and limma) was incredibly helpful, since I was able to balance filling in blanks, writing my own code, and understanding the already written code.	Kind of a double edged sword, I thought that the group aspect of the projects could be a bit unhelpful at times, especially since the work was often not divided very equally. Especially being online, it could be really stressful at times trying to meet with my group so we could all work together. Oftentimes, it just fell into a cycle of a few people doing all of the work and the rest of the people being somewhat unresponsive. But that is not the fault of this group as a whole at all!! I think that was just a personal issue I ran into.	NA	NA	NA	4	NA	I would prefer to go deeper into topics instead of moving so quickly through them, especially when it came to the languages. I would have preferred to stick with R the entire time (or python the whole time).	I would have been interested in a crash course on statistics, at least for p-values, p-adjusted values, and some of the other output values of the differential analysis codes.	NA

Great job you guys!! Thank you so much for all the hard work you've done for us this semester :')
82	2021	Spring	NA	Command Line / Github	NA	NA	NA	NA	The overall exposure to different languages. Throughout this group, we have learned how to navigate Terminal using several bash commands, how to use R and create different forms to visually represent data, and even elementary Python. 	The accelerated pace of Python. I understand that this felt so rushed due to the lack of time that we had with learning Python but I would say that as a beginner to the language, I didn't learn that much other than the bare basics. 	NA	NA	NA	3	NA	Maybe once things are back to normal, we can host events that allow us to know each other a bit more. We can eat, hang out, play games, etc., I think that it would be key to focus a little bit more on Python since this language is used in several research labs making it more applicable in more fields of research. 	Queuing jobs! I know that especially for research with larger pieces of data, local machines will struggle to run this much code and so using the cluster will be much more advantageous. 	This has been an awesome experience and to be honest, it was an accident that I joined this group but I'm glad that it happened! Although I was lost for the most part and felt overwhelmed, I still learned so much and hope to continue learning more as I continue my journey in QBIO. Thank you so much Kate and Terence!

NA	NA	NA	4	NA	None, I think other than pacing everything was perfectly fine., Not really, other than maybe extending the time frame just to slow down the pace a bit?

Thank you for running a great student group this semester!!!

Teamwork. Scientific paper writing	Pretty much everything had a strong benefit. More time on python would have been a bit better but it was also more important to get through R content so I understand why it was not covered as much	NA	NA	NA	5	NA	Market the hell out of it if it continues. This was one of the most beneficial experiences I have had since arriving at USC and I think everyone in QBIO should get this low-stakes high-reward experience., At first it might have been a bit tough for the people with more coding experience to carry along the people without much, so maybe an optional office hours session focusing on a new skill each week for people with less experience would help get the inexperienced folks up to speed a bit faster	I think everything was great in the context in which we were taught. Seemed to me like everything we hit upon was important and not too difficult for everyone to get up to speed on	I think if the summer thing were to happen it would be fun to chat about current research people are doing if that is what people have going on so we can bring in some more ideas about what is going on outside of the group.

It has been a really rewarding experience	there is a little bit of a learning curve that comes with computational stuff, even in a more structured setting. the tutorials and lectures at the beginning of the semester felt disjointed at times	NA	NA	NA	4	NA	As this is a group run for and by students, I think it'd be beneficial to have a few breaks built in to the schedule, so we'd don't feel so burnt-out. I also would have preferred either ending the group a few weeks before the end of the semester, so that the group project didn't coincide with finals, or even extending the group a little after finals, to have more time to work on the project without feeling overwhelmed., It would be useful to start a folder or document similar to the dictionary doc in the drive just with code that we used frequently (like rsync, git pull/push, maybe even the starter code for the TCGA files we used). This would be easier to refer to than going back and finding specific slides from weeks ago	maybe introducing statistics concepts that would be relevant for interpreting our figures and learning a little more about the biology of breast cancer/putting our work into a broader context	Thank you both so much for a great semester! I truly appreciate all the hard work you've put into making this group so beneficial for us and for helping build community in the qbio program virtually :) I'm gonna miss you guys next year!

The final project was a valuable experience for me. I just prefer having individual projects rather than group projects. 	I really appreciated how we learned how to use tools for research in class. I was really nervous getting into research because I didn't want to be thrown in. I think now I will be more confident when applying to research positions.

Actually yes! I like that we got to choose what to explore on our own and I feel like I really understood the practical use of R when using it to answer a specific question. I like that we were also given some to time work on it in class which made it convenient to ask questions. 	I do! It taught me a lot about proper time management and how to work efficiently in a group. I also learned some problem solving skills when it came to working around the issues we faced based on some lack of data. 	This was unlike any other course I’ve taken at usc, especially stem related courses. The whole program was really designed for us to succeed and this was shown through the many our Kate, Nicole and David put in to helping us outside of class. I feel like this course was very well paced. Even when I felt confused I never felt like I was hopelessly falling behind. We also did so many practice examples that made me understand why we were learning certain things in class and the mid semester/final project really tied all we had learned together in a more real world application. I also know there is no way I would have figured out how to use GitHub on my own. I also liked that we got an introduction to python and I also feel like the transition from R to python was really smooth and actually made sense. 	I can’t really say anything wasn’t valuable. Even though I didn’t enjoy the python aspect of the class too much, I still understand how useful it is and I know this introduction to python will definitely help with any future python classes I take. 	NA	NA	NA	NA	I am not dreading joining a lab nearly as I was before taking this class. I never really understood that lab could cover many different aspects and doesn’t have to be taking bio samples all day. I also think that I won’t fail miserably anymore thanks to some skills I learned in class. 	I made comments in the last survey about doing more in-class examples and I definitely saw that this was implemented in the second half of our class. That alone made such a huge impact for me and it helped to not suffer in silence at home when doing the homework. I would say that I came out with a much better understanding of R than python. This could just be because I was more tired as the end of semester came close so I wasn’t paying as much attention. But I think a bit more time could be spent on the python part of the class when compared to R. 	High performance cluster was actually pretty interesting to me. I was a bit confused on how to read certain charts but I do think they tell you a lot about genes and are very useful for drawing conclusions. I would have liked to spend more time understanding this. 	NA

I think without the project the methods and its explanation would have been difficult to write. I also believe that you were not lost due to all the homework resources and aid you got for these projects 	I think this was my first official project that showed the importance and the difficult nature that is research. It was hugely rewarding to see the end result for all the work spent and I think it showed the importance of working with people in a project you all are passionate in . I think to improve could be a very vague example to just show the structure but honestly that isn’t even needed as you showed everything clearly 	Learning ways to read papers and use basic code for R and Python	Nothing !!	No	1	No	5	This class taught me to venture into areas I found interesting while still wanting to learn. Computational research is a lot more complex and just as frustrating since some results don’t work!

Yes, it was really interesting to study and learn a lot about something I knew basically nothing about. I'm not sure if I have any suggestions to improve it because I feel it was straightforward and organized well by the instructors.

They were a great way of summarizing everything I had learned in the unit, and also served as a valuable resource to refer back to when I was working on the final project.  	I'm grateful to have a project that I feel comfortable talking about in the future as I pursue different research and internship opportunities. I definitely liked that we had the ability to choose our research direction because it forced us to be creative with what we wanted to do with our project; it served as a good capstone for everything we learned in the course. I also loved working with my peers; I learned a lot from their experience and had the opportunity early on to meet others in my major.   I think it would've helped if we had some sort of example (maybe last year's projects?) just to better understand the expectations as well as see how previous students progressed through the research process. 	Though I knew in theory how computer science was applied to biology, I think that being able to do it myself really showed me all the different things we can learn from just one dataset. I feel more comfortable understanding what kind of work in research can be done; if I was to read a research paper, I feel like I could come up with my own ideas about possible "next steps."	I genuinely don't think that there was anything that was "least valuable"; I learned a lot from each class. 	No	2	No	5	I'm not in a lab yet, but I feel more comfortable with the idea of reaching out to professors to  discuss research I'd be interested in. Because of the experience I've gotten, I feel like I wouldn't have to overcome as steep of a learning curve. If / when I join a lab, I think I could pose my own research question and plan out a project that I was interested in.  	I think it would have been nice to have more time on the final project. Maybe it could be introduced a bit earlier during the course in conjunction with the Python unit, just so we have a bit more time to do some thinking about what we would want our project to look like. 	I think I would like to see more of machine learning; it was a topic I was already interested in prior to joining the class, but there didn't seem to be enough time to do more with it. 	NA

The final project was a good application, but perhaps it could be introduced throughout the course and students can expand on their project after particular lessons (intro to CPTAC, intro to ML) to better facilitate a longitudinal research design rather than a precipitated one. 	The most valuable aspects are learning crucial coding skills for bioinformatics analysis as well as being able to apply biological data into our analyses.

They improved the versatility of my understanding of R and Python and helped my debugging skills.	Yes, experience in developing my own computational project is a skill directly translatable to my research endeavors. This was a very well-rounded project and I can't think of much to be improved, but more opportunities for feedback on the research paper could have been helpful.	Video tutorials, meeting other QBio students (I've never seen one in the wild), resume feedback, and the direct applicability of the skills we learn to research.	Personally, I am going to say the "finding a lab" lecture because I was already in one haha. This entire course has been so transformative in my understanding of QBio and I cannot think of an aspect that wasn't valuable.	Yes	NA	Yes	NA	Having no programming experience prior to taking this course, I found it to be extremely useful as my lab also works with large amounts of data but is mainly focused on wet lab.

They were good. But could see how they could be extremely challenging for someone with less coding experience. Especially the ML. That was a lot to cram in just a week or two.	Extremely valuable. Just make it less work for people. Maybe cut down some mid-semester content and start focusing on it like halfway through the semester..	Learned a ton.	NA	Yes	NA	Yes	NA	Yes I still found the class useful. I kinda took it as I was getting started in my lab so it was helpful	Just less work so down on content i suppose. This class was more work than my other 4-unit classes. I could see how it could really mess up people's performance in some of their other classes.	Could have talked about stats more, but there are other courses in that and already so much to cover in this course.	Great experience overall, despite the large workload.

Yes! I think they were a very complete way to connect what we just learned with things we had learned before and ensure we know how to apply and use them before getting to the big final project. 	Yes!	Very interesting, fun and overall a nice experience. I've never seen the level of comraderie I saw in this class in ANY other class I've taken. I think also learning from my peers aside from the instructors was a big advantage. And also the instructors being around our age I feel like made it easier to ask for help or simply admit that I didn't understand something.	None, I think it was a positive experience. 	Yes	NA	Yes	NA	This class was very useful despite already being in a lab. I learned a lot about analysis methods and ways to go about analyzing stuff. I would've liked to take this class before joining in a lab so I would've realized that computational stuff is more interesting than wetlab stuff for me.	I think some of my peers said they felt like the class was a bit confusing in the coding portions for people that had no prior coding experience. Personally, I don't see this but I had experience before. But the people that said that didn't hesitate to ask for help, which I think really helped to build community in this class cohort, so it worked out in the end and I don't think it was an entirely bad thing then. 	ML	I've said this 1000x times, but very cool! Good job guys :) Really impressive that you all put in so much time and effort to help us and go above and beyond WHILE being students. Thank you!!

I feel like some review sessions/re-caps of basic functions in both R and Python could be helpful just to provide a refresher (esp since many of us are overwhelmed with information learning programming for the first time) 	The final project was super valuable in "putting it all together" and seeing how many different applications there were to what we learned in the class. I think a bit more time and guidance in formulating initial hypothesis/analyses would be helpful so working on it wouldn't be so last-minute. 	Definitely all the R and Python assignments and the final project. 	literature presentations?

I did enjoy being able to apply the coding and analysis skills.	I felt kind of alienated from the actual research aspect of my final project, it felt like I was kind of just doing analyses just to do them. Maybe having suggested directions to take your research in would help you feel more connected to the research but I felt that overall the final project was super interesting.

No	NA	Yes	NA	My time in the class made me feel more confident in my ability to be useful in a lab.	Some of the coding sections felt really rushed to get through everything, maybe having part of the code taught online before class (such as basic syntax + skills) would allow the more complicated and integrated skills aspects to be taught and explained better.

I would have liked if we were provided a template/outline for the mid-semester project to help guide us in writing the code (like a similar set-up that the assignments have with tips and hints). I also wish we had more time to complete the project.	I felt that the final project was a valuable experience for me. I just wished we had more time to do the project, maybe an entire month versus 2-3 weeks. I also found the group meetings with the instructors really helpful; I think having more check-ins with the instructors throughout the projects would make things easier.	The most valuable aspects of this course was the individual meetings with the instructors and office hours. All of the instructors were always eager to help, and were understanding about students' individual needs for additional assistance and extensions.	I felt everything was valuable. I think the course could be improved, though, if there was more time for in-class instruction.	No	1	No	3	I am not in a lab yet, but taking this class made my perception of computational research feel less scary. I was initially nervous about joining a lab, but I now feel that I have a good foundation of introductory skills to join a lab.	I know there is not a lot of time available for this class, but I think it would be really helpful if more time could be granted to complete the final group project. I also think more in-class instruction time would be valuable, like possibly increasing the class length from 1 hour twice a week to 1.5 hours twice a week.	I would like to have seen more of the coding in detail. I think slower-paced, more thorough coding lectures would be helpful, especially for completing assignments (video or in-person).	I enjoyed the course overall. It felt less stressful than other courses in the sense that it was taught by your peers who understand what it's like to be a student themselves.

It was pretty good and builded upon the previous coding assignments. It could have been potentially improved by doing an in-class review of the skills prior to the project.	It was pretty good as it helped us really apply and understand more in-depth the reasons why we did the analysis and plotting, paired with scientific literature and presentation.

Overall, I enjoyed this course and I thank Mahija and Wade for being great instructors especially being full-time students simultaneously. In terms of pacing, I think it could be good to establish a consistent pace especially with the final projects. In terms of content, it could be helpful to have focus on understanding what each plot means, when and why to use it, and connecting it back to biological understandings (can help for the final project).

Yes, because it covered everything we had learned up till that point and allowed me to learn methylation analysis better.	Yes, it was a valuable experience for me.	Review project, all of the assignments because I  learned something new each time. The final project was also valuable because we got to devise our own research question and answer it.	N/A	Yes		Yes		This class was very useful because now I’ve learned about various R packages that can be used in my research (e.g. making survival plots, volcano plots)		Would be cool to see a unit on machine learning as that is becoming very popular in cancer research.	
S73	2024	Fall	Presentation Skills, Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature	Command Line / GitHub, Basic R (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific R (i.e. SummarizedExperiments, MAF files, plotting, maftools, DESeq2, etc.), Presentation Skills, Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature		Prefer to have a video lecture to introduce everything at home, then do practice questions in class (flipped lecture style)	The literature presentation was okay, but seemed a little busy. I would rather have worked on technical skills in R, but I understand that the project is necessary to complete the scientific literature objective.	I learned a lot during the coding portion of the final project. I wish we learned more about the function of p-values in class (though I understand this is a QBIO 305/310 concept).	Coding in R	Literature review	No	2	No	5	I am more comfortable looking into dry lab research now.	All good!	Statistics (p-values). There were some proteomics charts during the final presentations that I was unfamiliar with and would like to learn too.	
S81	2024	Fall	Basic Python (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific Python (i.e. numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.), Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature	Command Line / GitHub, Basic R (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Basic Python (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific Python (i.e. numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.), Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature		It worked well!	Yeah it felt pretty valuable, can't really think of anything to improve it.	Overall yes, I did not expect it to take so much time because thsiwas a 2 unit course, but yes I did learn a lot.	Learning R. The main thing I got from this course were the basics of R.	Comprehending scientific paper did not feel that useful, or at least, we didn't need to spend as much time as we did on it.	Yes		Yes	5	I found another lab halfway through this course, so this course was pretty helpful because I do need to use R in the lab.	Don't spend as much emphasis on scientific literature.		
S72	2024	Fall	Command Line / GitHub, Basic Python (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific Python (i.e. numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.), Machine Learning (sklearn, classification, dimensionality reduction, etc.), Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature	Command Line / GitHub, Basic R (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific R (i.e. SummarizedExperiments, MAF files, plotting, maftools, DESeq2, etc.), Basic Python (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific Python (i.e. numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.), Machine Learning (sklearn, classification, dimensionality reduction, etc.), Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature		It worked well!	Yes! I think it was a good foundation for the final project but also a good way to familiarize ourselves with current applications of the tools we were learning about.	The final project was valuable in being able to put everything that I had learned together, but I felt like the timing of it was pretty stressful since it overlapped with so many of my last midterms and projects for other courses. I'm not sure if that last point can be improved on though seeing how that's just what happens at the end of the semester.	The most valuable aspect of this course was learning to use CARC.	The least valuable aspect of this course for me would be some of the in-class code-along days just because it was sometimes difficult to see the code on the projector, and then once I fell behind, it wasn't something I could catch up on in the moment.	Yes		Yes		I think when I first started my computational lab work, I was a little overwhelmed with scientific programming since I had so little experience with it. Now, I do a lot of cell clustering and dimensionality reduction, and even though it doesn't directly overlap with the tools from this course, I think having this course as experience beforehand would have given me more confidence going into my lab.	I think the code itself is one of the easier parts to figure out, but the underlying logic could be better explained in lecture, for example, the value in looking at germ-line vs somatic mutation data or understanding the mutation types.		
S79	2024	Fall	Command Line / GitHub, Basic R (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific R (i.e. SummarizedExperiments, MAF files, plotting, maftools, DESeq2, etc.), Basic Python (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific Python (i.e. numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.), Machine Learning (sklearn, classification, dimensionality reduction, etc.), Presentation Skills, Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature	Command Line / GitHub, Basic R (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific R (i.e. SummarizedExperiments, MAF files, plotting, maftools, DESeq2, etc.), Presentation Skills, Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature		Prefer to have a video lecture to introduce everything at home, then do practice questions in class (flipped lecture style)	Yes, very meaningful experience to be able to practice all the skill on SKCM	Yes, but as I mentioned, more time could be given	Cooperation, R skills, and being able to use CARC	Paper writing kinda needs more instruction	No		No	5	Great demonstration of how a QBIO research would be like			
S82	2024	Fall	Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature	Command Line / GitHub, Basic R (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature		It worked well!	The R-review project (??) was a good way to recap everything	I do, even though it was difficult and I dislike presenting, I feel like it was valuable experience	Definitely experience, being exposed to these topics and R is very helpful, also I enjoyed meeting other students and the Ellison Institute	felt like a lot of work for 2 units	No	1	No	3	I think I want to do computational research, or at least smt dry.	Pace at the end was extremely fast compared to the much slower pace in the beginning.		
S69	2024	Fall	Basic R (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.)	Command Line / GitHub, Basic R (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific R (i.e. SummarizedExperiments, MAF files, plotting, maftools, DESeq2, etc.), Presentation Skills		It worked well!	I think the literature was good practice reading a research paper and ultimately helped prepare us for our final presentation.	I think that the final project was very useful in terms of coming up with a research question and writing a paper summarizing our results. I think possibly introducing it earlier and having more class times dedicated to working on it earlier in the semester would have been helpful for the workload.	I think the R review project was very helpful for helping me practice and summarize everything we learned.	I wish we could have started coding a little bit earlier in the semester	Yes		Yes	4	Yes, my lab involves R so this would have helped me with that	I feel like the beginning of this class was very slow paced but ended up becoming very fast paced by the end so maybe figuring out a way to spread the work more evenly	Maybe more statistics	
S83	2024	Fall	Command Line / GitHub, Basic Python (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Presentation Skills, Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature	Command Line / GitHub, Basic R (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific R (i.e. SummarizedExperiments, MAF files, plotting, maftools, DESeq2, etc.), Basic Python (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Presentation Skills, Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature		Prefer to have a formal lecture introduction of everything in-person, then do practice questions at home.	Yes, it helped in preparation for the final. it did however not feel like a mid-semester project, it was just kind of put in and then immediately after we are working on the final project	yeah, it was good for me to practice scientific research skills.	following along with r code during class and having us do some parts	not sure	No	1	No	3	I am not in a lab yet, but I am still a bit intimidated to start research because I feel like I'm not entirely comfortable with coding in R	definitely more lessons on syntax, the first homework helped but I would always forget how to write something but that could also have been me because I kept getting my languages mixed up, oh also, if I had missed a class it was hard following along with just the lecture slides, and I also wouldn't have any of the code that was made during class, at least I did not see anything in the class repository with updated code. Also, when we coded in class you would go a bit too fast and I would be missing some lines.	not really, i liked the stuff i learned	na
S86	2024	Fall	Basic Python (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific Python (i.e. numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.), Presentation Skills, Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature	Command Line / GitHub, Basic R (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific R (i.e. SummarizedExperiments, MAF files, plotting, maftools, DESeq2, etc.), Basic Python (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific Python (i.e. numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.), Machine Learning (sklearn, classification, dimensionality reduction, etc.), Presentation Skills, Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature		Prefer to have a video lecture to introduce everything at home, then do practice questions in class (flipped lecture style)	In theory, yes, but I ended up pushing it off so hard that "R Review" became "learn R" and did it after the final project.	Yes! I think having a presentation deadline really forced me to prioritize this and especially with the panel helping me realize that the original paper had an issue in it was really cool	Community! I got to know my fellow QBIO majors, but it took a bit longer than I hoped it did.	I thought the pacing was tough: The first weeks were really slow and since I was only able to make one of the days, I didn't have much motivation to catch up on the past lectures because I could skim the slides and understand; however once the material started ramping up in the middle of midterms, I started falling behind significantly.	Yes		Yes	5	My lab works in python where I'm fitting a foundation model to their data so this wasn't directly relevant, but if I was in an R lab it would be helpful.	I think the pace could be improved by doing starting R earlier and going through how to use the packages early on, just so students don't expect the pace to be really slow.	Since I used CARC for my lab, I wished we covered python in CARC (at least in terms of setting it up even if we didn't do any assignments in it) since most intro classes have python in jupyter locally and python in CARC isn't taught.	
S84	2024	Fall	Presentation Skills, Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature	Command Line / GitHub, Basic R (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific R (i.e. SummarizedExperiments, MAF files, plotting, maftools, DESeq2, etc.), Basic Python (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific Python (i.e. numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.), Machine Learning (sklearn, classification, dimensionality reduction, etc.), Presentation Skills, Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature		Prefer to have a formal lecture introduction of everything in-person, then do practice questions at home.	I liked the mid-semester review project. I learned a lot about Epigenomic level analysis with that project and overall it was rewarding when all my codes run and gave me good results. I think it would be better if we could introduce and go over epigenomic part more in class next time. That was a really interesting omic and I feel like we didn't have enough time to go over it in class. I did struggle to get the Epigenomic part done right.	I think it was a pretty valuable experience. It would just be a lot of work for the three of us at the final weeks. It would be a lot better if we could get a bigger group, less work, or longer working time. It was hard for us to get all the work done in time.	Besides all the wonderful lectures on R and analyzing TCGA data, I really appreciated the lecture on finding research at USC. It was a unique experience and I gained a lot of insightful knowledge through that lecture. I also liked the med/industry panel day, had a lot of great speakers and great contents. I loved the Ellison field trip.	I can't really think of any. I think all the aspects in this class are pretty valuable to me.	No	2	Yes	5	I am just starting in a lab doing bioinformatics research on genomics level of cancer cfDNA. This course well prepared me for the basics of R and HPC, which are essential in the work I am going to do in the future.	I really liked this class! I feel like it would be a lot better if we have longer class periods and go over the codes in class together. It was a little frustrating trying to learn the coding part for epigenomic part alone at home. It would also be great if the overall workload could be more balanced. I feel like the first half of the semester we didn't have much work but jumping to the finals the Review Project and Final Project were really time consuming. It would be great if those workloads are spread evenly during the semester so we didn't need to do all the work toward the end of the semester.	I would like to see all topics in more detail :) They are all really interesting.	
S76	2024	Fall	Basic Python (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Presentation Skills	Command Line / GitHub, Basic R (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Basic Python (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Presentation Skills, Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature		Prefer to have a formal lecture introduction of everything in-person, then do practice questions at home.	I liked it as a check in to see how well I was understanding the class so far.	I liked the final project because I was able to many parts of the research process, condensed into one month.	I liked how hands on the class was and I think it was a good first exposure to R and computational research. I also liked how small the class with, I felt that helped me connect with a lot of new QBIO classmates!	I think everything we did was valuable. Sometimes the classes were a little difficult to keep up with.	No	1	No	3	It made computational research seem less scary and something that I'm capable of doing.	I think all the content taught was interesting and important. I think that some of the classes, especially ones involving in-person coding with R, were a little too fast paced and difficult to keep up with.		
S77	2024	Fall	Presentation Skills	Command Line / GitHub, Basic R (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific R (i.e. SummarizedExperiments, MAF files, plotting, maftools, DESeq2, etc.), Presentation Skills, Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature		It wouldve been cool to try flipped lecture style. Was pretty hard for me to understand everything in one sitting	idk what this is but if it was the Research project than yes it was a valuable experience. I think that's what made me comfortable with scientific R. Was really helpful for writing the final paper.	Yea it definitely was. I think my group needed some assistance with our hypothesis because I don't think it was a very good question as demonstrated by our results(or lack of).	I think this course was a great introduction to computational biology and has really motivated me to explore more of it. While I found it to be difficult, the final project was really valuable as we had to have some sort of open ended question/hypothesis that we had to apply what we learned in class to.	Not sure if this counts but it was really easy for me to fall behind. I think most of it comes down to this being my first semester and having trouble adjusting with a much harder course load and clubs outside of school. Really has nothing to do with the course but I do wish that I focused/was able to focus more on it this semester	No	1	No	4	It has really opened my eyes to what computational research actually is and has done a great job of preparing me for my search for a lab and understanding what I want to get out of one(and of course what I'd want to give to a lab).	I think at times the lectures moved quite fast and there were a lot of things that I thought other people found intuitive that went straight over my head. I think this also just comes down to me not asking as many questions as I should've to be honest.		
S70	2024	Fall	Command Line / GitHub, Basic R (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature	Command Line / GitHub, Basic R (i.e. syntax, documentation, etc.), Scientific R (i.e. SummarizedExperiments, MAF files, plotting, maftools, DESeq2, etc.), Presentation Skills, Reading and Comprehending Scientific Literature		It worked well!	Yes, I feel that it was a valuable experience for me. I was able to use the R code/skills we learned in lecture and apply it to a different cancer. The suggestions I have would be to post lecture videos/associated code a little earlier and to include more code examples on the lecture slides, just because I felt a little lost during the process and would have liked more resources (especially for methylation).	Yes, I feel that the final project was a valuable experience for me. I was able to research a cancer I was interested in and look through it from a multi-omic lens. The suggestions I have would be to give more time to work on it (ex: make it due after the final week of classes; I had a lot of other work during the final week so this made it difficult for me to manage time) and to post more resources (like PantherDB) beforehand, since we didn't know how to fill in the gaps of our research until practice presentations.	Learning R/coding/data analysis skills, practicing presentation skills, learning about how to find research, building a community among QBIO students in a more casual classroom setting	I thought all aspects were valuable :)	No	1	No	4	This class made more interested in conducting computational research and I hope to enter a dry lab where I can further exercise my data analysis/coding skills.	I think that the final project should be pushed later and the R Review project should be pushed a little earlier, since it was difficult to transition into the final project after completing the R Review project.	I still would have wanted to practice Python since I don't have a lot of exposure using it.	Thank you for teaching this semester! :)
