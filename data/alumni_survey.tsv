8/27/2023 20:32:05	Third year	QBIO mailing list communications, QBIO advising	Medicine	Scientific communication, R, Python	3	It showed me that I would prefer medicine but that having a background and understanding of science through a lens of a quantitative biologist is beyond valuable.  	3	Same reason as above	5	I love this format and our teachers we're amazing. 	Yes	I think its a trial and learn by fire class, but with the safety net of not failing. You're there to learn, and thats the focus. 	
8/27/2023 20:33:56	First year	QBIO mailing list communications, QBIO advising	Medicine	Scientific communication, Linux/Command line, Python, Machine learning, Big data analysis	3	I was strongly committed to medicine both before and after QBIO 490. The course pushed me to consider pursuing the computational side of academic medicine more, though. 	4	It definitely showed me that there was a lot more going on within the field than just the area of my research project I was working on at the time.	4	Peer-teaching made the course lower-stakes and the content more approachable, which probably at the same time lowered the effort I put into the class.  	Yes	Great intro to the field for those just getting started in their UG studies.	
8/27/2023 20:48:09	Fourth year	Heard from Kate Guion/Remo	Medicine	Scientific communication, R, Python, Big data analysis	3	I was already set on Medicine, but the course helped me learned valuable skills that I still use today.	5		4		Yes	Great way to learn basics of big data research. Very relevant projects/data source. Skills will be very transferrable across fields.	
8/27/2023 21:11:31	Second year	Recommended by a previous participant, QBIO mailing list communications	Medicine	Scientific communication, Linux/Command line, R, Python	2	I was interested in medicine prior to joining QBIO 490, and the course helped reinforce that decision by developing my analytical and scientific communication skills. 	5	Learning R and undergoing the processes of literature review, writing a manuscript, and conducting my own analysis improved my perspective and self-perceived competence in the field. 	5	To be taught by a cohort of students who are not significantly separated by the particular vogue of another educational period helped me communicate better with my instructors and address my questions.	Yes	This course gave me a robust introduction to R that has served me tremendously in other departmental courses such as QBIO 481, 401, 310, 475, etc. 	
8/29/2023 10:04:36	Second year	QBIO mailing list communications	Industry	Scientific communication, Big data analysis	4	This course exposed us to several career options for our QBIO degrees, from academia to industry. Doing research like this and presenting at places like the Ellison Institute confirmed my desire to work in this industry, doing stuff like big data analysis.	3	Was already fairly invested in the field.	3	Was nice to have understanding from our peers leading the course, but at the same time, it was clear why teaching is a skill that needs to be worked at. 	Yes	Good for getting research credit, and I learned a lot about data analysis.	
8/30/2023 18:09:50	Second year	QBIO mailing list communications	Industry	Scientific communication, Linux/Command line, R, Python	5	Before the class, I thought I wanted to pursue a career in data analytics, and this class confirmed that I am really interested in that field.	5	It gave me a broader idea of the types of careers QBIO is good for.	5	I liked that the environment was more relaxed than a typical class.	Yes	I found this class very helpful in demonstrating how the skills we learn as QBIO students can be applied in a real research setting.	
9/1/2023 13:53:53	Second year	QBIO mailing list communications, QBIO advising	Medicine	R, Python, Big data analysis	2		4		3		Yes	Helpful with learning more about Python and R as well as applying them to real-world projects	The class needs to be renamed something asap (ex. QBIO 491)
9/7/2023 10:20:27	Third year	QBIO mailing list communications, QBIO advising	Industry	Scientific communication, Linux/Command line, R, Python, Big data analysis	5	Helped prepare me for what would be expected of me as a computational biologist, increased my excitement for work in the field	5	Gave me a better idea of what work outside of college would be like, was reassuring that I was in the right field	5	It was great to be taught by peers and learn the different shortcuts and tricks to improving Linux/python performance	Yes	It is the best way to gain experience in a forgiving setting and a great way to interact with fellow QCB students! I also took this prior to 490 eligibility and still think it was extremely worth it	
9/7/2023 12:56:28	First year	Recommended by a previous participant, QBIO advising	Medicine	Scientific communication, Linux/Command line, R	1	I am pretty set on the pre-med track. However, taking the course diversified my skill set and bolstered my ability to find research and other activities beyond just a "stereotypical" pre-med path.	5	Taking 490 made me much more comfortable with the QBIO major. Having very little coding experience in high school, being in a small class, upper-classman led environment made the material much more approachable.	5	Having an upperclassman or recent grad lead the course made asking questions and office hours less intimidating. Furthermore, the 1:1 meetings throughotu the seemster to check in on progress and goals made me feel more connected to the QBIO community overall.	Yes	I would strong recommend this course, especially to underclassmen as it develops key skills, increases QBIO community engagement, and promotes confidence in future QBIO classes.	
9/7/2023 14:12:12	First year	Saw it on my own	Medicine	Scientific communication	2	I realized that I didn’t like the actual implementation of big data analysis as I thought I would be.	4		3	There were points where the lack of actual teaching expertise was apparent, but at the same time the casual/familiarity really helped during office hours and one-on-one help.	Yes	I think it provides a good insight into the field, as well as very practical skills that will definitely be of us—whether that’s directly or in very practical ways to think about data and it’s analysis.	
9/7/2023 23:05:13	First year	QBIO mailing list communications, QBIO advising	Industry	Scientific communication, R, Python	4	QBIO 490 was one of the most interesting classes I have taken thus far into school. I enjoyed the class because it exposed me to very niche bio/CS topics that lower grade level students generally don’t get the chance to study, and to be able to articulate said topics through practical projects only stimulated my curiosity for the field further.	4		3	When I took QBIO 490, our class had a diverse mix of students of various grade levels and CS experience. Having practically no knowledge about coding or computing, I found it challenging to grasp certain topics and tackle projects. If QBIO 490 were to remain at the same difficulty level, I would think extending lectures could be beneficial to students that are new to CS.	Yes	As mentioned earlier, QBIO 490 provides a unique deep dive into complex topics, complete with hands on projects that will enrich your learning experience.	Thank you Nicole and David(though he’s not here anymore) for all your hard work during the spring 22 semester!
9/7/2023 23:33:39	Second year	Word of mouth (I joined when this group first started!)	Industry	Linux/Command line, Python, Machine learning	5	I discovered that I preferred coding/the "dry lab" type of work we did compared to the wet labs done in general bio/chem classes, which led me to switch my major to Computer Science	5	This was one of my favorite parts of being part of QBIO back when I was still in the major.	5	The peer-taught aspect made the group feel more accessible and less intimidating than jumping straight into doing research under a professor. It was also a lot more fun because it was so collaborative--it truly felt like a STUDENT community	Yes	I learned a lot, had a lot of fun, and got a lot of value out of this group	
9/8/2023 11:02:44	Third year	QBIO mailing list communications	Industry	Scientific communication, Linux/Command line, R, Big data analysis	5	Before taking the class, I had limited experience in R, and 0 experience in Python, Linux/the command line, or multi-omic/public data analysis. Now, I’m starting my PhD at UCSF, where I’m interested in exploring multi-omic cancer data!	5	this class does a fantastic job of introducing it’s students to the field of quantitative and computational biology. I learned highly-transferable computational skills that would serve to benefit any role in biology involving computation.	5	Being taught by fellow students made the learning environment feel comfortable and less daunting. Seeing students just a year or two older than me teaching the class made me confident that I could learn the material.	Yes	This was one of the most useful courses I took at USC! I think every QBIO student could derive benefit from taking it.
